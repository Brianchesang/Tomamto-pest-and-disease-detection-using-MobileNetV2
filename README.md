# Tomamtoe-pest-and-disease-detection-using-MobileNetV2
in this project  I train a MobileNetV2 neural network to be able to predict the pest or disease that a  tomato plant has based on the image of the leaf.

The project was trained on a combination of two datasets:

1.Huang, Mei-Ling; Chang, Ya-Han (2020), “Dataset of Tomato Leaves”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/ngdgg79rzb.1

2.Huang , Mei-Ling; Chuang, Tzu Chin (2020), “A database of eight common tomato pest images”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/s62zm6djd2.1
